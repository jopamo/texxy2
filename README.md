## Install 📦

### From source

**Requirements**
- Qt 6.2+ (Core, Gui, Widgets, Svg, PrintSupport, DBus)
- CMake 3.16+ and a C++17 compiler

**Build**
```bash
git clone https://example.com/texxy.git
cd texxy
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"

## Usage ▶️

```bash
texxy [file1 [file2 ...]]
```

* Drag a file from your file manager into Texxy to open it in a new tab
* Middle-click a tab to close it
* Detach a tab by dragging it out of the window

## Configuration ⚙️

Texxy uses Qt settings; most options are available from the UI. Power users can tune behavior (for example, visibility of the search bar, line numbers, side-pane mode) via the app’s settings dialogs 🧩
